As we can see from the histogram above, the Petal length of the Setosa flowers are tightly situated between 1 and 2 centimetres, with the majority being around the 1.5-centimetre mark.
The length of the other two species cover a much larger range, between 3 centimetres and just under 7 centimetres. 
Despite this it seems the petal length of the Iris Virginica is easily distinguishable as the largest of the 3 species of flower.
